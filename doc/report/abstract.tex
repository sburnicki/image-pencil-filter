\section*{Abstract} 
This paper describes the Cuda implementation of an advanced pencil sketch
filter, based on the work of Cewu Lu, Li Xu and Jiaya Jia\cite{mainPaper}.  It
explains the used methods of the original paper and briefly states the
improvements made for parallel computing.  Extremely fast computation times and
very realistic sketching results are achieved with this version of
implementation.  The most complex kernels are being explained step by step and
stress tested with the profiler.  Future improvements are being mentioned and a
conclusion is drawn of the project results, especially for the usability as a
video filter.
