\section*{Abstract} 
This paper describes the Cuda implementation of an advanced pencil sketch
filter, based on the work of Cewu Lu, Li Xu and Jiaya Jia \cite{mainPaper}.  It
explains the used methods of the original paper and discusses the derived
implementations for parallel computing. Details of the most complex kernels are
explained throughout the paper, as well as some important modifications to improve
performance. The result of this work are extremely fast computation times and
very pleasing looking pencil sketch images.
