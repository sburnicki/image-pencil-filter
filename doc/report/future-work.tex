\section{Future Work} \label{future-work}
In the scope of our project we didn't jet implement the entire pipeline of the
original paper. 

The quality of our line sketch filter for example could be boosted by getting
rid of the blurriness, which would require one further processing step which is
described in \cite{mainPaper}.

As mentioned before it would be nice if there was a way to construct matrix
$A^*$ and vector $b^*$ directly on the GPU with the data, that is already
there. This might be possible with the use of \texttt{cusp}s LinearOperator
classes.

Currently the parameters of the filter have all have to be set manually. It
would be helpful to create some parameter presets, which can be
selected and adapted on the fly. Those presets could be created on the fly
and saved to disk or learned from real pencil drawings as in \cite{mainPaper}.

For this a GUI with realtime response would be great to immediately see the
response. 

If one could find a way to enforce temporal consistency in real time the filter
could be used to stylize entire video sequences. It might be worth it to take a
look at \cite{temporal-consistency} for this purpose. With precalculated optical
flow it might actually be possible to reach realtime performance.
