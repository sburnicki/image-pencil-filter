\section{Conclusion}
We used modern technologies for parallel computing on GPUs to implement
an image filter to create pencil sketches from real images based on the
methods of a published paper.
In the course of this, common operations like color mode conversion,
gradient calculation, convolutions, histogram creation, and histogram
matching have been implemented as parallel working algorithms.
Our benchmarks results show that the speed of the image filter would even
be sufficient to apply it in real time for videos. This result is clearly an
indicator for a successful and efficient GPU implementation of the image
filter.
