\section{Conclusion}
A simple and efficient approach was presented that simplifies difficult global
optimization problems like optical flow and disparity calculations using
temporal edge aware filtering. The method creates temporal consistent results
for many image based graphics problems. Sparse feature matches can be used as
input for the joint filtering operation to replace costly global minimizations.

There are some limitations to the approach. It is possible that objects are not
detected if they do not provide enough features to match. This issue can be
addressed by adapting the parameters of the feature matcher to find as many
features as possible. The effect of faulty features is minimal as their
confidence is low, so they are filtered out.

As the method relies on edge preserving filtering problems occur if important
object boundaries are not well defined in the input images. Unwanted bleeding
artifacts can show up on such edges. Special care must be taken in the scribble
propagation application to place the input scribbles close to edges, as object
boundaries could otherwise be missed which causes unwanted color bleedings. A
true global solution does not suffer from this problem. The authors suggested an
extension that could fix this issue.

For me as writer of this report the described method in the paper was quite easy
to comprehend and written in enough detail for a full reimplementation.
